    </div>
    <ul type="i">
        <li>Indus Valley Civilization is also known as Harappan Civilization because Harappa was the first site to be
            excavated in 1921 under the supervision of Daya Ram Sahni.
        </li>
        <li>The known extent of IVC is up to Suktagendor in Baluchistan in the west; Alamgirpur (UP) in the east;
            Daimabad (Maharashtra) in the South; and Manda (Jammu & Kashmir) in the north.
        </li>
        <li>Indus Valley Civilization is the home to the largest of the four of its contemporary urban civilizations
            namely Mesopotamian or Sumerian Civilization, Egyptian Civilization, and Chinese Civilization.
        </li>
        <li>While IVC is on the banks of Indus, Egyptian Civilization flourished on the banks of the river Nile,
            Mesopotamian Civilization flourished on the banks of Tigris or Euphrates river and Chinese Civilization
            flourished on the banks of Hwang Ho river.
        </li>
        <li>Since it belongs to the Bronze/Chalcolithic age, it is also known as the Bronze Age Civilization.
        </li>
        <li>In the 1920s, the excavations were carried out in the Indus Valley regions, where ruins of the old cities
            were found. The first city to be unearthed was Harappa.
        </li>
        <li>In 1924, John Marshall, the then Director-General of the Department of Archaeology announced the discovery
            of Indus Valley Civilization
        </li>
    </ul>

    <ul style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: brown;">
        <ul style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-weight: 600;">Three phases of IVC are:
            <li>The early Harappan phase from 3300 BC to 2600 BC.
            </li>
            <li>The mature Harappan phase from 2600 BC to 1900 BC.
            </li>
            <li>The late Harappan phase from 1900 BC to 1300 BC.
            </li>
            <li>The signs of a gradual decline of the Indus River Valley Civilization are believed to have started
                around 1800 BC and by 1700 BC, most of the cities were abandoned.
